# heliostat studies

This page collects documents, images, source codes and formulas about "heliostats", "special mirrors" used to make solar light static while sun crosses the sky.

## Source codes

### Made with Three.js

#### Parabola3.html [source](https://github.com/jumpjack/heliostat/blob/main/parabola3.html), [live demo](https://jumpjack.github.io/heliostat/parabola3.html))

Paraboloid customizable by user. No mirrors, because Three.js has so many versions, subversions and variants that I was not yet able to figure out whic version to use to create a reflective mirror..

### Made with BabylonJS

#### Parabolic mirror 001 ([source](https://github.com/jumpjack/heliostat/blob/main/parabolic-001.html), [live demo](https://jumpjack.github.io/heliostat/parabolic-001.html))

It displays in 3d space a paraboloid with one hexagon parallel to each face; ideally the cylinder should be turned into a real reflector capable of reflecting surrounding objects, to simulate how moving sun appears in the mirror.

To do:
- each face currently has two mirrors oriented slightly differently, but only one mirror should be presemt
- "mirrors" are currently just cylinders, they do not reflect
- paraboloid should be modifiable by user (inclination, height, width,...)
- moving sun to be added
- mirrors to be made smaller and denser
